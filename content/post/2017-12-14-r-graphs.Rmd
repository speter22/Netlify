## Scatterplot

Start by downloading three packages

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)

```

Next, get the data from a query in sqldf. We're finding players that have hit 400 or more hr'ss in their career.

```{r}
query<-"select playerID,sum(HR) as career_HR,sum(SO) as career_SO
from Batting
group by playerID
having sum(HR)>=400"

result<-sqldf(query)
```

Here we make a scatterplot with the data stored into result. 

```{r}
ggplot()+
   geom_point(data=result,aes(x=career_SO,y=career_HR),size=3,color="blue")
```

Add bells and whistles

```{r}
ggplot()+
   geom_point(data=result,aes(x=career_SO,y=career_HR),size=3,color="blue")+
   ggtitle("Career Strikeouts VS Homeruns for Great Hitters")+
   xlab("Career Strikeouts")+
   ylab("Career Homeruns")
```

## Histograms

Search for the data you want to plot and store as a result. 

```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(ggplot2)
library(sqldf)
```

```{r} 
query<-"SELECT weight
 FROM Master"

 result<-sqldf(query)
```

Now format the graph with data drawn from result. Bins are the number of individual results. 

```{r}
ggplot()+
   geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color="blue",fill="white",bins=50) +
   ggtitle("Body weight")
```


## Time Series

Pull data to be charted against time. Example, Babe Ruth homeruns.

```{r}
 query<-"SELECT yearID,HR
 FROM Batting
 WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"

 result<-sqldf(query)
 
 ```

Points can be connected by adding a line, hence the geom_line command. Otherwise it's the same as scatterplot.

```{r}
 ggplot()+
   geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
   geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
   ggtitle("Ruths Homeruns")+
   xlab("Year")+
   ylab("Homeruns")
```

## Bar Plot

Search for data
```{r}
query<-"SELECT teamID,sum(SB) AS total_SB
FROM Batting
WHERE playerID='loftoke01'
GROUP BY teamID
ORDER BY sum(SB)"

result<-sqldf(query)

result$teamID<-factor(result$teamID,levels=result$teamID)
```
add the bar plot.

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_bar(data=result,aes(x=teamID,y=total_SB),stat='identity')
```
